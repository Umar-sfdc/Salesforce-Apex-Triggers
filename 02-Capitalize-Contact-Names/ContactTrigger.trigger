ðŸŸ© Q2: Capitalize Contact Names
ðŸ§  Story: A CRM admin noticed that contact names are saved in mixed or lowercase formats like john doe. They want to clean this up and ensure that every Contactâ€™s first and last name starts with a capital letter.
ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement:
 Write a before insert and before update trigger to convert FirstName and LastName fields to proper case (e.g., John, Doe).

*/

trigger ContactTrigger on SOBJECT (before insert, before update) {
    ContactTriggerDispatcher.dispatch(Trigger.OperationType);
}
